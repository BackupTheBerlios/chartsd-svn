REQUIREMENTS
============

  - libgd (gd) (http://www.boutell.com/gd/)
  - libconfuse (confuse) (http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/)

NOTE: Without the libraries above, this application will not build!


Optional Requirements
=====================

If you want to log temperatures of your cpu, mainboard or harddiscs,
you'll also need the applications which do this:

  - lm-sensors
  - hddtemp


Basic Installation
==================

  1. A simple "./configure && make && make install" should do it.

  2. After building and installing, you have to copy the whole directory
     "./charts.d" to /etc. It contains some sample configurations which
     can be used to generate charts about the temperatures of the whole 
     system.

  3. Now you have to copy the file "./scripts/templog" to /usr/bin
     This executable script will log your temperatures into a logfile,
     which can be read by chartsd.
     
  4. You should create some cronjobs for the looging-script:
     */1 * * * * /usr/bin/templog cpu &>/dev/null
     Take a look into the sample config files for how the logfile
     has to be formatted
     
  5. Finally, you have to create an init-script for the chartsd daemon.
     the daemon has to be started as much charts you want, each instance
     with its own configuration file.
     (chartsd -c /path/to/config.file)
