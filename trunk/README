[chartsd] README


What is this?
=============

chartsd is a daemon which generates 2D line diagrams from
any log-file which has a specific format.
It can be used to generate 2D line diagrams of the statistical usage
of the temperatures of the cpu, mainboard, harddiscs or 
whatever.
It also can be run more than once to generate more than one 
2D line diagram of more than one source log-file.


How to use this?
================

The preparations:
First of all, you have to create an init-script for the daemon
or to copy the sample-init-script.sh from /usr/share/chartsd
to /etc/init.d/chartsd.1 or /etc/rc.d/chartsd.1, this depends 
on your distribution.

NOTE: The daemon can be run more than once, so you have to name 
the init-script like the instance, you want to run the daemon:
for the first daemon, use "chartsd.1" as filename of the init-
script, for the second daemon, instance two, you have to name
the init-script "chartsd.2" and so on.

If you want to run the daemon more than once, you also have to 
change the variable "instance" in the init-script to reflect
the instance, which also is reflected by the name of the init-
script.

How to use the daemon:
Now you can start or stop the daemon by using the init-
script(s).

NOTE: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND COMMENTS IN THE CONFIGURATION-
FILES IN "/usr/share/chartsd" CARFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH 
A LOGFILE HAS TO LOOK LIKE AND HOW TO USE THE CONFIGURATIONS.

You also have to change the configurationfile-path in the 
init-script to refelct your settings and logfiles.
